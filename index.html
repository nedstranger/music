      <div class="abouttext">
         <p>I've always felt like two different people trapped in one body. On the one side, I'm an unapologetic oversharer and polyamorous idealist, never more comfortable than when dropped in a room of new people. On the other, I'm a nerd â€“ a logical, book-loving Cambridge law graduate who relaxes between songwriting sessions by writing Medium articles, doing the cryptic crossword, and looking up niche cricket stats. The two worlds collide in my songwriting, where I write about anything from my mother's fear of not being remembered, to my favourite 19th century French mathematician.
         <br>
         <br>
         Originally from the Sussex countryside in south England, I formed my indie-folk duo August and After with my best friend at Cambridge. Together we moved to London and secured millions of listeners across the world with numerous Official Spotify playlistings and features on BBC Radio, Songwriting Magazine and The Independent. In late 2022 I moved permanently to Vienna with my wife (a super talented Latvian-born artist called Anya Vero) and began collecting stories and philosophies around our polyamorous lifestyle. In growing my concert audience for my solo project - a mix of classical guitar, piano and storytelling lyricism - I've been lucky enough to work with Vienna's prestigious Volkstheater, TedX Vienna and various Sofar Sounds across Europe.
